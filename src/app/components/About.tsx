            <p>
              Hey there! I'm Pratik and my journey has taken a fascinating turn.
              Originally trained in aviation as an Aircraft Maintenance
              Engineer‚úàÔ∏è, I thrived on precision and problem-solving. But then
              2020 happened, and the aviation industry faced unprecedented
              challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other global events.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In January 2023, I decided to switch gears and dove headfirst into
              the world of web developmentüë®‚Äçüíª, specializing in the MERN stack.
              The learning experience has been a whirlwind of excitement, with
              the chance to be mentored by some of the best in the field.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Now, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to put my skills to the
              test. My career shift is not a setback; it's a transformation. I
              bring a unique blend of problem-solving from my aviation
              background and the fresh creativity of web development. I'm eager
              to collaborate and make a positive impact on new projects.
            </p>
